Amazon Cart

Project Overview

This project is a personal endeavor to replicate the cart functionality of the Amazon website. It aims to simulate the experience of adding items to a shopping cart, updating item quantities, removing items, and viewing the total cost, much like on the actual Amazon platform. This replica is designed to demonstrate frontend and backend integration skills, including handling state management, updating a user's cart, and calculating totals dynamically.
